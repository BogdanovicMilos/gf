                        <p>Besides possessing confidence in our system that enables us to offer $500 to companies accounts who we cannot improve, there are some mechanic differentials in how we buy media.</p>
                        <p>No matter the platform we are buying media on, we start with a customer avatar process that is extremely unique to Growth Foundry.</p>
                        <p>Most teams build avatars primarily on demographics and some savvy marketers look at psychographics or actual search behavior. We do those things but also build client empathy maps to ensure congruent messaging, offers, and content is delivered to the right person at just the right time.</p>
                        <p>Our onboarding process consists of a full media planning ecosystem being created complete with interviews with your clients/customers and a deep dive into your current product, offerings, and content.</p>
                        <p>An A-Z inventory of what marketing assets you possess and what you will need is developed. This plan is created with your team, our content marketing specialists, designers, and media buyers.</p>

                        <p>When we get the media plan approved and begin, one of the secrets we don’t care about sharing is our ability to rapidly test, optimize, and prepare your campaign for scale. Our media buyers will get busy implementing our 4x4 method.</p>

                        <p>This is where ad groups are made in clusters of four with each of them containing four ad variations. This allows us to find winners exponentially faster without slowly testing and bleeding ad budget for months before discovering the winners. We move fast. You will never bleed marketing dollars with us. We market our own services and businesses and treat yours like ours. No wasted spend, only ROI positive activities.</p>
                        <p>There are a plethora of smaller details we will refine. Which media to create or use and the frequency in which it should be served and updated. Landing page and funnel tweaks and optimizations.</p>
